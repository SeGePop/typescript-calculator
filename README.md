Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

User Input: It prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
Validation: It checks if the inputs are valid numbers and a valid operator.
Calculation: If the inputs are valid, it calculates the result based on the operator.
Output: It then outputs the result to the console.
The code uses functions like isNumber to validate numeric inputs and isOperator to confirm the operator. The calculate function performs the actual arithmetic operation. If the input is invalid, it outputs an error message and restarts the process. The main function orchestrates the flow of the program.
